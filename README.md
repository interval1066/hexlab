# hexlab
This is a mimic of Breakpoint Software's Hex Workshop for Windows. After inspecting the few hex editor offerings available for linux I believe this is the best application design for such an application so here it is for Linux. The other designs suck. 
I'm doing this not so much as a nessessary application but as an excersise in application design for gnome.

In this app I offer a number of windows designs such as a most recently used file list, drag and drop, and other windows innovations. I'd like to offer this app as a model for other desktop apps for linux as the field right now is thin. I really want to offer Linux as a desktop alternative to Windows, especially if your tired of paying the ever-climbing license fees for windows and osx.
