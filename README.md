ABANDONED
=========
This is a mimic of Breakpoint Software's Hex Workshop for Windows for the Gnome desktop, in an attempt to learn how to create a full featured application using GTKMM. After the latest refresh of gtkmm 3.0 (Gtk::ActionGroup is depricated in favor of  GLib::SimpleAction, for example) I'm abandoning GTKMM. I like it, I think its easy to use, but these changes from Murray Cumming come in too fast and too radically. I was going to completely re-do the framework to make it more modular and STL compliant but few empoyers are looking for GTKMM devs so hell with it.
